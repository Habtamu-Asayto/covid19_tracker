# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
# short description 
This project aims to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data for selected countries (Ethiopia Kenya, China, and Afghanistan) using the OWID COVID-19 dataset.
The project includes data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of key metrics such as total cases, deaths, vaccination progress, and death rates.
The final cleaned data is saved to a CSV file for further analysis or sharing.
